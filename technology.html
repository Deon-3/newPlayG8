        <b class="playg8-title">Something a little bit different</b>
        <p>
            Whether you have a retro theme or not, guests will always flock to
            the digital jukebox and take control of sing choices with all the
            music they will ever need at their fingertips. It’s a great way to
            direct the attention of your guests and something to make their
            night a little bit extra special. The jukebox has enjoyed prized
            positioning at popular nightlife locations for decades. Music is a
            crucial element of any venue and patrons enjoy the ability to pay to
            play specific songs when they want to hear them. However, disc and
            record based machines limit the available music, both for standard
            play as well as selection for a customer base now used to unfettered
            digital access to a vast music library.

        <p>
            Venue operators have full control over what genres and songs are
            played on their machines. Restrictions can even be applied to music
            categories available to patrons since it would ruin the mood at a
            country club to suddenly have techno playing.

        <b class="playg8-title">A cost-effective alternative</b>
        <p>
            As everyone knows, Hiring a DJ can be expensive (and don’t get us
            started on a band), between the cost per hour and other equipment
            that you may have to pay, the prices just quickly add up. But now,
            the digital Jukebox is a much more cost-friendly alternative. Unlike
            a band or DJ, you won’t be charged by the hour with a digital
            Jukebox, but instead you’ll earn an income from the music played at
            your venue. The Playgate Digital Jukebox is by far your best
            cost-effective alternative adding value to your business.
