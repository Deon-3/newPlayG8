                Playgate, originally established as Coinplay by Christie Lötter in the
                early 2000s, has built a reputation for delivering high-quality,
                innovative software solutions. Since the launch of its first jukebox
                in 2005, the company has consistently set industry standards for
                excellence. <br />
                <br />
                In 2017, the company rebranded as Playgate to better reflect its
                expanded vision and to align with its relocation to the Western Cape,
                South Africa. This strategic shift allowed Playgate to venture into
                non-commercial markets where the Coinplay name was less suitable.
                <br />
                <br />
                At Playgate, we specialize in designing, developing, manufacturing,
                and supplying premium digital audio and video solutions for both
                public and private venues. Our product range includes advanced digital
                touchscreen jukeboxes, cutting-edge music solutions, video advertising
                systems, and cloud-based media services, all crafted to meet the
                highest standards of quality and innovation.

                <b class="playg8-title">Franchise Dynamics</b> <br />
                <br />
                <b>Franchise Governance:</b> Playgate Franchises operate under group
                policies that are established, enforced, and regulated collectively by
                the franchise members themselves. <br />
                <b>Annual International Conference:</b> These policies are reviewed
                and formalized annually at our international conference, ensuring a
                unified code of conduct across the group. <br />
                <b>Decentralized Decision-Making:</b> The management of the Playgate
                Franchise group is determined collaboratively by the franchises, not
                solely by the Head Office. <br />
                <b>Fostering Collaboration and Protection:</b> This collaborative
                approach safeguards the interests of all franchise members, fostering
                unparalleled cooperation and strong bonds of friendship within the
                Playgate community.

                <b class="playg8-title">Our Business Plan</b> <br />
                <br />
                When the concept of commercial coin operators collaborating toward a
                shared goal was first introduced, many in the industry were skeptical,
                claiming, "It will never work." At the time, competition was fierce,
                with operators viewed as rivals battling over territory. There was no
                code of conduct to regulate the industry and no established channels
                for resolving disputes. <br />
                <br />
                Today, thanks to the measures we’ve implemented since Playgate’s
                inception, we have become one of the strongest and most cohesive
                groups in the coin-op industry, demonstrating the power of
                collaboration and shared values.
