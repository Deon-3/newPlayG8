            At Playgate, we <b>prioritize exclusivity and strong partnerships</b>,
            which is why we do not sell or distribute our jukeboxes directly to
            individuals,<br />
            pubs, taverns, or bars. Instead, we supply our products exclusively
            through our appointed network of dealers, franchises, and partners.<br />
            This approach <b>ensures a trusted relationship</b> with our
            franchisees and <b>protects their investments</b>, providing them with
            the confidence<br />
            and peace of mind needed to grow their businesses.
